Testing and detecting the bottleneck, maybe we can get all
the information and make a knowledge base, and then get
a query of our own models.

We can make the excercise based in functions.

I think that maybe it's possible get the library information 
and save the data in models instead of use the library 
query, we can hive the information in a json object and 
after do the query directly, but we can to get firts all data.
